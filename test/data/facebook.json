Granted he's cute, and Gander & his hero dog friends make a huge difference in people's lives...but to dis the beard? Time to put this precocious pooch in the back yard. Read the link for his challenge, and my retort, below. \n---------\nBEARD BATTLE!!!\nOh, yes, I am most definitely in! But let's not pussyfoot around this wager thing, Lonnie -- Gander and I both have beards of divine bestowal...even if they could be shaved (and the beard itself would fight with the strength of ten men), either one of us would grow it right back in a week with no sweat.\n\nLet's put something SERIOUS on the table: our domes!! I'm talking Full Chrome. You and your losing partner were thinking too small (and on the wrong ends of our skulls) both Gander and I are deficient in fur on the top end...so I raise your unmanly bet: instead of our strengths, I dare Gander to lose ALL follicular product in our weakest area--on the TOPS of our skulls!\n\nThat's hitting where it hurts. And when I win, I will let you choose the finest groomer on the face of the planet to exact the price of shame and defeat from the top of Gander's head.\n\nIn the laughably unlikely event that I should *lose* the Beard Battle (I feel silly even mentioning this--it's like debating the existence of purple unicorns), then I will happily hold my head up low and let the Finest Barber In The World lather me up and scalp me down.\n\nYou ready to tuck tail yet??\nI'm calling out Rob DuBois!\n\nI propose a national Army Service Dog versus Navy SEAL Frog beard off. March 1-21. \n\nLoser shaves his beard.

I did receive some poorly done screenshots that showed another group made a donation to NYBC then canceled it. Does that mean NYBC did something wrong? No. I got a link to a forum and a website with a timeline of events. Again, no screen captures. I can write a timeline of events about how unicorns had a slumber party at my house, would you believe it?\n\nIf you are going to accuse a group of wrong doing, come with some hard evidence and please don't be upset with us because we don't jump on every bandwagon that travels through our town.\n\nP.S. YES, I mistakenly said Chris when I meant Craig (Craig runs NYBC and was more than happy to share his side of the story with us on the phone). A snarky commenter (who was deleted) implied I got the name wrong because we didn't have a long conversation. No, I got the name wrong because I'm human and make mistakes.\n\nAnyway, check out NYBC's adoptables here: http://nybullycrew.org/adoptables-2/ they deserve to be shared with everyone you know because in the end, this is about DOGS, not personal vendettas.",
